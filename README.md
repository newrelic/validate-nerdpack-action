# Validate Nerdpack Action

A GitHub Action to check for the presence of our standard open source files, catalog files (if applicable), and package script commands.

## Inputs

| Key        | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `files`    | no       | -       | Comma-separated list of files to validate existence for. These are appended to default list of files, unless `override` flag is set to true. |
| `path`     | no       | -       | Sets the directory the Action will run from.                                                                                                 |
| `override` | no       | false   | By default, the files option will append to the default list of files being checked. This flag allows overwriting the whole list.            |

## Example Usage

### Basic validation

The following example shows how to use the valiate-nerdpace-action to ensure all Nerdpack standards are adhered to in a Pull Request.

```yaml
name: "Build and Validate Nerdpack"

on:
  pull_request:
      branches:
        - master

jobs:
  validate-nerdpack:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: "Validate Nerdpack"
        uses: newrelic/validate-nerdpack-action@v1
        with:
          files: "package.json, LICENSE, README.md, foo, bar"
      
      # Now run nr1 nerdpack:validate to ensure nerdpack is able to be published
      - name: Install NR1 CLI
        run: |
          curl -s https://cli.nr-ext.net/installer.sh | sudo bash
      - name: Validate Nerdpack Schema
        run: |
          nr1 nerdpack:validate
```

## Custom Input Options

          override: true
          path: ./apps/nr1-browser-analyzer # set Action to run from base Nerdpack directory
      
      # Now run nr1 nerdpack:validate to ensure nerdpack is able to be published
      - name: Install NR1 CLI
